### 🌐 Live Demo  
👉 **Try it here:** [DataMate Streamlit App](https://datamate.streamlit.app/)

---

**DataMate** is an **AI-integrated data exploration and preprocessing assistant** built using **Streamlit**. It lets you **chat with your data**, clean it intelligently, and perform in-depth **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** — all from one interactive dashboard.

No need to juggle between Jupyter notebooks, SQL, and Python scripts — just upload your dataset and let **DataMate** handle the rest!

---

### 💡 The Problem DataMate Solves

Data cleaning and exploration often take up **70-80% of a data scientist’s time**.
Between handling missing values, outliers, feature selection, and generating insights — it's easy to lose focus on the actual modeling or business problem.

**DataMate** eliminates this bottleneck by providing an **interactive, AI-driven workspace** that automates preprocessing, guides feature engineering, and explains your dataset conversationally.

### 🌍 Real-World Impact

* **For Data Scientists** → Rapidly preprocess and explore data without switching environments.
* **For Students & Beginners** → Learn EDA and data cleaning concepts with step-by-step AI explanations.
* **For Companies & Analysts** → Speed up decision-making with instant, visual insights.

By integrating **LLM (Language Model) intelligence** directly into the EDA workflow, DataMate helps you understand not just *what* your data says — but *why*.
